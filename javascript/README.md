This is the implementation of glitchfuck seen on the [N64 Sherbet Land radio](https://gba.ioi-xd.net/). Unlike the reference implementation, this generates the gradients based on the unix time, resulting in a mostly smooth animation that changes throughout the day (based on UTC time). This also means there are no command line arguments.

An insane being would have written this in WebGL/GLSL but I'm horrible with trigonomotry/calculus, and anyways I thought it'd be cool if this worked on older browsers since it's for a radio station that plays tracker music ~~even though the current version doesn't work on RetroZilla and thus doesn't have Windows 98 support~~. **The tradeoff comes in speed, especially on Chrome. If you are looking to put this on your own website and don't care about browser compatibility, I encourage you to rewrite it in WebGL/GLSL.**
